# Load Data

We first want to load our datasets and perform some basic manipulation similar
to those done for the association rules mining.

```{r load_transaction_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_data_tbl <- read_rds("data/retail_data_cleaned_tbl.rds")

tnx_data_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


We model the purchase data first, then combine this to create an individual
customer/invoice pairing with the total amount spent as an additional column.

```{r prepare_purchase_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_purchase_tbl <- tnx_data_tbl %>%
  filter(
    quantity > 0,
    exclude == FALSE
    ) %>%
  select(
    invoice_date, invoice_id, stock_code, customer_id, description,
    quantity, price, stock_value
    )

tnx_purchase_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Use of BTYD models assumes a total spend over a period of day and those
differences between the times. This is calculated internally by the various
BTYD routines so we keep just the per-invoice spend.

```{r calculate_customer_daily_spend, echo=TRUE}
daily_spend_invoice_tbl <- tnx_purchase_tbl %>%
  drop_na(customer_id) %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id, invoice_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    invoice_spend = sum(stock_value)
    )

daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>% glimpse()


daily_spend_tbl <- daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    total_spend = sum(invoice_spend),
    tnx_count   = n()
    )

daily_spend_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


Finally, we want to set a date to make the end of the "fitting" data, which
will be used in the various estimation routines to fit parameters of our models.

```{r set_training_data_date, echo=TRUE}
training_data_date <- as.Date("2011-03-31")
```


# Background Theory

Before we start working on fitting and using the various Buy-Till-You-Die
models, we first need to discuss the basic underlying theory and model.

In this model, we assume a customer becomes 'alive' to the business at the
first purchase and then makes purchases stochastically but at a steady-rate
for a period of time, and then 'dies' - i.e. becomes inactive to the business -
hence the use of "Buy-Till-You-Die".

Thus, at a high level these models decompose into modelling the transaction
events using distributions such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial, and then
modelling the 'dropout' process using some other method.

A number of BTYD models exist and for this workshop we will focus on the
BG/NBD model - the Beta-Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution model (though
we will discuss the P/NBD model also).

These models require only two pieces of information about each customer's
purchasing history: the "recency" (when the last transaction occurred) and
"frequency" (the count of transactions made by that customer in a specified
time period).

The notation used to represent this information is

$$
X = (x, t_x, T),
$$
where $x$ is the number of transactions observed in the time period $T$ and
$t_x$ was the time of the last transaction.

From this summary data we can fit both P/NBD and BG/NBD models.


## Beta-Geometric/Negative-Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD) Model

This model relies on a number of base assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with parameters shape $r$ and rate
  $\alpha$. 
  1. After any transaction, a customer becomes inactive with probability $p$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Beta distribution $B(p \, | \, a, b)$ with
  shape parameters $a$ and $b$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout probability $p$ vary
  independently across customers.


Note that it follows from the above assumptions that the probability of a
customer being 'alive' after any transaction is given by the Geometric
distribution, and hence the Beta-Geometric in the name.


## Pareto/Negative-Binomial Distribution (P/NBD) Model

Similar to the BG/NBD model, the P/NBD model relies on five assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with shape $r$ and rate $\alpha$. 
  1. Each customer has an unobserved 'lifetime' of length $\tau$. This point at
  which the customer becomes inactive is distributed as an exponential with
  dropout rate $\mu$.
  1. Heterogeneity in dropout rates across customers follows a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(\mu \, | \, s, \beta)$ with shape parameter $s$ and
  rate parameter $\beta$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout rate $\mu$ vary
  independently across customers.


## Gamma/Gamma Spending Model

The final piece of this approach is to construct a spending model for the
transactions. Similar to transaction rates, spending patterns are often
skewed, so a Gamma distribution is used.

For the Gamma/Gamma model, we use the following assumptions:

  1. Each transaction amount, $v_i$, is distributed according to a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(v_i \, | \, p, \nu)$ with shape parameter $p$ and
  rate parameter $\nu$.
  2. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(p \, | \, q, \gamma)$




## BTYD Visualisations

Despite our extensive exploration of the data earlier, the concepts around 
BTYD modelling suggest a few more than are worth exploring, so we will look at
those now.

To start with, it might be worth understanding a bit more about when customers
are 'born' in the system - that is, the date on which they make their first
purchase. Another important quantity is the time between transactions for a
customer, we we will visualise these.

```{r construct_customer_first_date, echo=TRUE}
customer_firstdate_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    first_tnx_date  = min(invoice_date),
    total_tnx_count = n()
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    cohort_qtr = first_tnx_date %>% as.yearqtr(),
    cohort_ym  = first_tnx_date %>% format("%Y %m"),
    
    .after = "customer_id"
    )


customer_firstdate_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Now that we have a first date for each customer, we look at the total number
of customers joining at each date.

```{r plot_customer_first_dates, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  count(first_tnx_date, name = "n_customer")

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_line(aes(x = first_tnx_date, y = n_customer)) +
  labs(
    x = "First Transaction Date",
    y = "New Customers",
    title = "Plot of Count of New Customer by Date"
    )
```

We know look at how time differences between purchases are distributed.

```{r plot_transaction_time_diffs, echo=TRUE}
customer_tnx_diffs_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    time_diff = diff(invoice_date) %>% as.numeric() %>% divide_by(7)
  )

mean_diff <- customer_tnx_diffs_tbl %>% pull(time_diff) %>% mean()

ggplot(customer_tnx_diffs_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = time_diff), bins = 50) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean_diff), colour = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Histogram of Differences Between Transactions for Customers",
    subtitle = glue(
      "Mean Difference is {mean_diff} weeks", mean_diff = mean_diff %>% round(2)
      )
    )
```


We also want to look at a number of customers and make some line plots of their
transactions.

```{r visualise_customer_transactions, echo=TRUE}
keep_customers_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(total_tnx_count > 2) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 30)

plot_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  semi_join(keep_customers_tbl, by = "customer_id")

ggplot(plot_tbl, aes(x = invoice_date, y = customer_id, group = customer_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Transaction Date",
    y = "Customer ID",
    title = "Visualisation of Transaction Times for 30 Customers"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))
```


## Investigate Cohorts

Finally, we want to take a look at the distribution of transaction times based
on various first-transaction cohorts in the data.


```{r plot_distribution_first_transaction, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(customer_firstdate_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = first_tnx_date), bins = 50) +
  labs(
    x = "Date of First Transaction",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of New Customer Start Dates"
    )
```

We also want to get a sense of the total count of customers in each cohort.

```{r construct_qtr_cohort_column_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  count(cohort_qtr, name = "customer_count") %>%
  mutate(cohort_qtr = cohort_qtr %>% as.character())
  
ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cohort_qtr, y = customer_count)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Customer Cohort",
    y = "Customer Count",
    title = "Bar Plot of Customer Quarterly Cohort Sizes"
    )
```

We also want to see the monthly cohorts:

```{r construct_ym_cohort_column_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  count(cohort_ym, name = "customer_count") %>%
  mutate(cohort_ym = cohort_ym %>% as.character())

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cohort_ym, y = customer_count)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Customer Cohort",
    y = "Customer Count",
    title = "Bar Plot of Customer Monthly Cohort Sizes"
    ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 20, vjust = 0.5)
    )
```


For the cohort analysis, we start with a boxplot of the time difference between
transactions by cohort.

```{r plot_cohort_differences_boxplot}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  inner_join(customer_tnx_diffs_tbl, by = "customer_id") %>%
  mutate(cohort_qtr = cohort_qtr %>% as.character())

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = cohort_qtr, y = time_diff)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "Cohort",
    y = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    title = "Boxplot of Time Differences by Starting Cohort"
    )
```

We also construct a density plot of the time differences for these cohorts.

```{r investigate_cohort_transaction_times, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(plot_tbl, aes(x = time_diff, colour = cohort_qtr)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  geom_dl(aes(label = cohort_qtr), method = "top.bumpup", stat = "density") +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Comparison Density Plot for Transaction Time Differences Between Cohorts"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

And we also look at a facetted-histogram

```{r investigate_cohort_timediffs_facets, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = time_diff), bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(vars(cohort_qtr), scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Facetted Histograms of Time Between Transactions"
    )

```


### Investigate Dropout Rates

We want to plot some visualisations of the lifetime and dropout rate of
customers in each cohort.


```{r estimate_cohort_dropout_rates, echo=TRUE}
cohort_dropout_est_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  select(
    customer_id, first_tnx_date, cohort_qtr, cohort_ym
    ) %>%
  filter(
    first_tnx_date <= training_data_date
    ) %>%
  inner_join(daily_spend_tbl, by = "customer_id") %>%
  group_by(cohort_qtr, customer_id) %>%
  mutate(
    final_tnx_date = max(invoice_date)
    ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(
    customer_id, cohort_qtr, first_tnx_date, final_tnx_date
    ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(
    obs_lifetime = difftime(final_tnx_date, first_tnx_date, units = "week") %>%
      as.numeric()
    ) %>%
  filter(obs_lifetime > 0) %>%
  group_by(cohort_qtr) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    lifetimes = list(obs_lifetime)
    )

cohort_dropout_est_tbl %>% glimpse()
```




# Create Initial BTYD Model

We want to start building and investigating our initial BTYD models and there
are two main packages we will use for this process: `BTYD` and `CLVTools`.

## First BTYD Model

We start using the `BTYD` package, using the various functions provided.

```{r create_initial_btyd_model, echo=TRUE}
daily_cbscbt <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  select(cust = customer_id, date = invoice_date, sales = total_spend) %>%
  dc.ElogToCbsCbt(
    per             = "week",
    T.cal           = training_data_date,
    merge.same.date = TRUE
    )

params_btyd_bgnbd <- daily_cbscbt$cal$cbs %>%
  bgnbd.EstimateParameters()


bgnbd_tnxfreq <- bgnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration(
  params  = params_btyd_bgnbd,
  cal.cbs = daily_cbscbt$cal$cbs,
  censor  = 15
  )

bgnbd_tnxrate  <- bgnbd.PlotTransactionRateHeterogeneity(params = params_btyd_bgnbd)
bgnbd_droprate <- bgnbd.PlotDropoutRateHeterogeneity    (params = params_btyd_bgnbd)

bgnbd.Expectation(params = params_btyd_bgnbd, t = 52)

bgnbd.PAlive(params = params_btyd_bgnbd, x = 5, t.x = 26, T.cal = 30)
```





## First CLVTools Model

We also want to fit an equivalent model in `CLVTools` but this requires a bit
more work upfront as it requires you to explicitly remove new customers in the
data.

For this we keep all customers in the cohorts up to Q4 2010, and use that
data to fit our models.

```{r construct_btyd_fit_data, echo=TRUE}
customer_fitdata_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  select(customer_id, first_tnx_date, cohort_qtr, cohort_ym) %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  inner_join(daily_spend_tbl, by = "customer_id")

customer_fitdata_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

We now use this data to construct the `clvdata` that will be used to fit our
models.

```{r construct_clvdata_structure, echo=TRUE}
customer_clvdata <- customer_fitdata_tbl %>%
  clvdata(
    date.format      = "%Y-%m-%d",
    time.unit        = "weeks",
    estimation.split = training_data_date,
    name.id          = "customer_id",
    name.date        = "invoice_date",
    name.price       = "total_spend"
    )
```

```{r show_clvdata_summary, echo=FALSE}
orig_width <- getOption("width")
options(width = 120L)
customer_clvdata %>% summary()
options(width = orig_width)
```

We now want to fit the BG/NBD model using this input data. Fitting these models
can take a bit of trial-and-error, but we can use our knowledge of the Gamma
and Beta distributions to give us starting points that seems reasonable and
this should help with the fitting process.

```{r fit_first_bgnbd_model, echo=TRUE}
params_bgnbd_clvfit <- bgnbd(
  clv.data = customer_clvdata,
  start.params.model = c(r = 0.5, alpha = 10, a = 0.1, b = 9.9),
  verbose  = TRUE
  )

params_bgnbd_clvfit %>% summary()
```

With our fitted model, we can now use these parameters to produce predictions
for the holdout period and compare it to what happened during this time - this
gives us a method of validating our model and discovering where we may have 
issues with the model.

Before we look at predictions, we look for the output plots.

```{r produce_bgnbd_plots, echo=TRUE}
params_bgnbd_clvfit %>% plot()
```

### Check Model Fits

We now want to check the validity of the fit by using these parameters to
generate some data and compare the outputs of this process against the data.

We first check the distribution of the transaction process. The model assumes
that the transaction rates $\lambda$ are distribution according to a Gamma
distribution with shape $r$ and rate $\alpha$. This suggests the average
rate is $r / \alpha$.

```{r check_transaction_rate_parameters, echo=TRUE}
predict_rates_tbl <- params_bgnbd_clvfit %>%
  predict() %>%
  mutate(
    lambda = CET / period.length
    )

predict_rates <- predict_rates_tbl %>% pull(lambda)

predict_r     <- params_bgnbd_clvfit %>% coefficients() %>% extract("r")
predict_alpha <- params_bgnbd_clvfit %>% coefficients() %>% extract("alpha")

sim_rates <- predict_rates %>%
  length() %>%
  rgamma(shape = predict_r, rate = predict_alpha)

create_summ_table <- function(x) {
  x %>%
    summary() %>%
    enframe() %>%
    mutate(value = as.numeric(value))
}

compare_tbl <- list(
    predict = predict_rates %>% create_summ_table(),
    sim     = sim_rates     %>% create_summ_table()
    ) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "source") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from  = "name",
    values_from = "value"
    )

compare_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

```{r show_rate_comparison_summaries, echo=TRUE}
compare_tbl %>% print()
```


We can also compare these two sets of data by plotting a histogram.

```{r compare_rates_histogram, echo=TRUE}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = predict_rates), bins = 50, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sim_rates), bins = 50, alpha = 0.5, fill = "red") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "Transaction Rate (per week)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Comparison Histograms of Transaction Rate for Predicted vs Simulated Data"
    )
```



### Investigating Spending Models


Now that we have plotted this data, we want to run our prediction routines on
the fitted data and look at the output.

```{r construct_bgnbd_predictions, echo=TRUE}
predict_bgnbd_tbl <- params_bgnbd_clvfit %>% predict()
predict_bgnbd_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

The above prediction depends on constructing a Gamma-Gamma based spending
model, which adds the monetary part of the model. To do this, we now plot the
fitted spending distribution against the actual spend to see how well we
capture the data.

```{r construct_spending_model_plot, echo=TRUE}
customer_spending_gg <- customer_clvdata %>%
  gg(verbose = TRUE)

customer_spending_gg %>% plot()
```


We also want to check the quality of the fit for the heterogeneity of the
spending patterns.

To do this, we note that it follows from above that the mean spending $\bar{x}$
is calculated from the Gamma distribution

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{p}{\nu}.
$$
We thus recover each individual customer $\nu$ from the mean spend by

$$
\nu = \frac{p}{\bar{x}}.
$$
We thus have a $\nu$ value for each customer, and then compare this empirical
distribution for $\nu$ against those drawn from a Gamma distribution with the
other parameters from the fit.


```{r check_spending_model_hetereogeneity, echo=TRUE}
params_customer_spending <- customer_spending_gg %>%
  coefficients()

spend_predict_tbl <- customer_spending_gg %>%
  predict() %>%
  mutate(
    nu = params_customer_spending['p'] / predicted.mean.spending
    )

predict_nu <- spend_predict_tbl %>%
  pull(nu)

sim_nu <- predict_nu %>%
  length() %>%
  rgamma(
    shape = params_customer_spending['q'],
    rate  = params_customer_spending['gamma']
    )
```

```{r compare_spending_nu_summaries, echo=TRUE}
nu_compare_tbl <- list(
    predict = predict_nu %>% create_summ_table(),
    sim     = sim_nu     %>% create_summ_table()
    ) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "source") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from  = "name",
    values_from = "value"
    )

nu_compare_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

As before, we construct a histogram of the two sets of data.


```{r comparison_histogram_spending_rate_parameter, echo=TRUE}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = predict_nu), bins = 50, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sim_nu), bins = 50, alpha = 0.5, fill = "red") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Customer Rate Parameter",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Comparison Histograms of Spending Model Rate Parameter for Predicted vs Simulated Data"
    )
```





# Additional Model Explorations

Another interesting way to think about the model fit is to break the data up
into the different cohorts, fit each subset of the data separately, then plot
each of the parameters of the model by cohort.



We also consider using a bootstrap approach to get an indication of the
variance in the parameter estimates.

Note that the two approaches have parallels - it is a simple idea from a
conceptual and implementation point of view, with the cost of additional
computation since we need to fit multiple models.


```{r convert_tnxdata_clvdata, echo=TRUE}
convert_tnxdata_clvdata <- function(tnx_data_tbl, end_date,
                                    spend_col = "total_spend") {
  customer_clvdata <- tnx_data_tbl %>%
    clvdata(
      date.format      = "%Y-%m-%d",
      time.unit        = "weeks",
      estimation.split = end_date,
      name.id          = "customer_id",
      name.date        = "invoice_date",
      name.price       = spend_col
      )
  
  return(customer_clvdata)
}
```

We 


```{r extract_bgnbd_parameters, echo=TRUE}
extract_bgnbd_parameters <- function(fit_clvdata) {
  mean_tbl <- fit_clvdata %>%
    coefficients() %>%
    enframe(name = "parameter", value = "mean")
  
  sd_tbl   <- fit_clvdata %>%
    vcov() %>%
    diag() %>%
    sqrt() %>%
    enframe(name = "parameter", value = "sd")
  
  params_tbl <- mean_tbl %>%
    inner_join(sd_tbl, by = "parameter")
}
```


## Investigate Cohort-Specific Model Fits

We now want to gather up the transaction data into the different cohorts and
use that subset of the data to fit models. We then visualise the differences
in the parameters using facet plots.

```{r fit_models_qtr_cohort_data, echo=TRUE}
qtr_cohort_bgnbd_tbl <- customer_fitdata_tbl %>%
  group_nest(cohort_qtr, .key = "tnx_data", keep = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    clv_data = map(
      tnx_data, convert_tnxdata_clvdata,
      end_date = training_data_date
      ),
    bgnbd_fit = map(
      clv_data, bgnbd,
      start.params.model = c(r = 0.5, alpha = 5, a = 0.1, b = 9.9)
      ),
    param_data = map(bgnbd_fit, extract_bgnbd_parameters)
    )
```

As a quick reminder of the parameters for the BG/NBD model, we have a counting
process for each customer $i$, $\lambda_i$, and these parameters are
distributed according to a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and
rate parameter $r$, i.e.

$$
\lambda_i \sim \Gamma(\alpha, r).
$$
The dropout process is a Geometric distribution with dropout probability $p$
(i.e. after each transaction the customer 'dies' with probability $p$), and
this probability is drawn from a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a$
and $b$, i.e.

$$
p \sim B(a, b).
$$

Before we move on to calculating the bootstrap estimates, we save these values
into a table as they will be used later.

```{r params_bgnbd_fit, echo=TRUE}
params_bgnbd_tbl <- params_bgnbd_clvfit %>%
  extract_bgnbd_parameters()
```



## Constructing Bootstrap Estimates

The nature of the summary statistics used to fit the BG/NBD model means
constructing bootstrap models is a little more involved than usual.

```{r construct_split_bgnbd_estimates, echo=TRUE}
construct_split_bgnbd_estimates <- function(tnx_splits, label,
                                            cutoff_date) {

  cache_file <- glue("precompute/{label}_cache.rds") %>% as.character()
  
  calc_file <- !file_exists(cache_file)
  
  if(calc_file) {
    tnx_clvdata <- tnx_splits %>%
      analysis() %>%
      group_by(customer_id) %>%
      mutate(
        first_tnx_date = min(invoice_date)
        ) %>%
      mutate(
        cohort_qtr = first_tnx_date %>% as.yearqtr(),
        cohort_ym  = first_tnx_date %>% format("%Y %m"),
  
        .after = "customer_id"
        ) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      filter(first_tnx_date <= cutoff_date) %>%
      clvdata(
        date.format      = "%Y-%m-%d",
        time.unit        = "weeks",
        estimation.split = cutoff_date,
        name.id          = "customer_id",
        name.date        = "invoice_date",
        name.price       = "invoice_spend"
        )
    
    tnx_clvdata %>% write_rds(file = cache_file)
  } else {
    tnx_clvdata <- read_rds(file = cache_file)
  }

  return(tnx_clvdata)
}
```

We now use this function to create a bootstrap distribution of the fitted
model parameters. We start by taking bootstrap samples of the transaction
data and then built the CLV data from that sample.

```{r construct_bootstrap_clvdata, echo=TRUE}
n_bootstrap <- 250

bootstrap_clvdata_tbl <- daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>%
  bootstraps(times = n_bootstrap) %>%
  mutate(
    boot_clv = future_map2(
      splits, id,
      construct_split_bgnbd_estimates,
      cutoff_date = training_data_date,

      .options  = furrr_options(globals = TRUE, seed = 421),
      .progress = TRUE
      )
    )

bootstrap_clvdata_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


From this set of bootstrapped CLV data we estimate parameters for each of the
bootstrap sample.

```{r fit_bgnbd_parameters, echo=TRUE}
fit_bgnbd_parameters <- function(clvdata, label) {
  
  cache_file <- glue("precompute/{label}_bgnbd_fit.rds") %>% as.character()
  
  calc_file <- !file_exists(cache_file)
  
  if(calc_file) {
    fit_bgnbd <- bgnbd(
      clvdata,
      start.params.model = c(r = 0.5, alpha = 5, a = 0.1, b = 9.9)
      )
    
    fit_bgnbd %>% write_rds(file = cache_file)
  } else {
    fit_bgnbd <- read_rds(file = cache_file)
  }
  
  return(fit_bgnbd)
}
```

```{r fit_bootstrap_bgnbd_parameters, echo=TRUE}
bootstrap_bgnbd_tbl <- bootstrap_clvdata_tbl %>%
  mutate(
    bgnbd_fit = future_map2(
      boot_clv, id,
      fit_bgnbd_parameters,

      .options  = furrr_options(globals = TRUE, seed = 422),
      .progress = TRUE
      )
    )

bootstrap_bgnbd_tbl %>% glimpse()
```




```{r plot_bootstrap_parameters, echo=TRUE}
get_coefs <- ~ .x %>%
  coefficients() %>%
  enframe(name = "parameter", value = "value")

bootstrap_fit_params_tbl <- bootstrap_bgnbd_tbl %>%
  mutate(
    param_data = map(bgnbd_fit, get_coefs)
    ) %>%
  select(id, param_data) %>%
  unnest(param_data) %>%
  inner_join(params_bgnbd_tbl, by = "parameter")

ggplot(bootstrap_fit_params_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), bins = 25) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), colour = "red") +
  facet_wrap(vars(parameter), scales = "free") +
  labs(
    x = "Value",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Facet Plot of Bootstrap Estimates of BG/NBD Parameters"
    )
```
