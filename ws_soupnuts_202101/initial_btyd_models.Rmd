# Load Data

We first want to load our datasets and prepare them for some simple association
rules mining.

```{r load_transaction_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_data_tbl <- read_rds("data/retail_data_cleaned_tbl.rds")

tnx_data_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

To use our rules mining we just need the invoice data and the stock code, so
we can ignore the rest. Also, we ignore the issue of returns and just look at
purchases.

```{r prepare_data_arules, echo=TRUE}
tnx_purchase_tbl <- tnx_data_tbl %>%
  filter(
    quantity > 0,
    exclude == FALSE
    ) %>%
  select(
    invoice_date, invoice_id, stock_code, customer_id, description,
    quantity, price, stock_value
    )

tnx_purchase_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Use of BTYD models assumes a total spend over a period of day and those
differences 

```{r calculate_customer_daily_spend, echo=TRUE}
daily_spend_invoice_tbl <- tnx_purchase_tbl %>%
  drop_na(customer_id) %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id, invoice_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    invoice_spend = sum(stock_value)
  )

daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>% glimpse()


daily_spend_tbl <- daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    total_spend = sum(invoice_spend),
    tnx_count   = n()
  )

daily_spend_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


# Background Theory

Before we start working on fitting and using the various Buy-Till-You-Die
models, we first need to discuss the basic underlying theory and model.

In this model, we assume a customer becomes 'alive' to the business at the
first purchase and then makes purchases stochastically but at a steady-rate
for a period of time, and then 'dies' - i.e. becomes inactive to the business -
hence the use of "Buy-Till-You-Die".

Thus, at a high level these models decompose into modelling the transaction
events using distributions such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial, and then
modelling the 'dropout' process using some other method.

A number of BTYD models exist and for this workshop we will focus on the
BG/NBD model - the Beta-Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution model.

This model relies on a number of base assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda | \alpha, r)$ with parameters shape $\alpha$ and rate $r$. 
  1. After any transaction, a customer becomes inactive with probability $p$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Beta distribution $B(p | a, b)$ with shape
  parameters $a$ and $b$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout probability $p$ vary
  independently across customers.


Note that it follows from the above assumptions that the probability of a
customer being 'alive' after any transaction is given by the Geometric
distribution, and hence the Beta-Geometric in the name.


## BTYD Visualisations

Despite our extensive exploration of the data earlier, the concepts around 
BTYD modelling suggest a few more than are worth exploring, so we will look at
those now.

To start with, it might be worth understanding a bit more about when customers
are 'born' in the system - that is, the date on which they make their first
purchase. Another important quantity is the time between transactions for a
customer, we we will visualise these.

```{r construct_customer_first_date, echo=TRUE}
customer_firstdate_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    first_tnx_date  = min(invoice_date),
    total_tnx_count = n()
    )

customer_firstdate_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Now that we have a first date for each customer, we look at the total number
of customers joining at each date.

```{r plot_customer_first_dates, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  count(first_tnx_date, name = "n_customer")

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_line(aes(x = first_tnx_date, y = n_customer)) +
  labs(
    x = "First Transaction Date",
    y = "New Customers",
    title = "Plot of Count of New Customer by Date"
    )
```

We know look at how time differences between purchases are distributed.

```{r plot_transaction_time_diffs, echo=TRUE}
customer_tnx_diffs_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    time_diff = diff(invoice_date) %>% as.numeric() %>% divide_by(7)
  )

mean_diff <- customer_tnx_diffs_tbl %>% pull(time_diff) %>% mean()

ggplot(customer_tnx_diffs_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = time_diff), bins = 50) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Histogram of Differences Between Transactions for Customers",
    subtitle = glue("Mean Difference is {mean_diff} weeks", mean_diff = round(mean_diff, 2))
    )
```


We also want to look at a number of customers and make some line plots of their
transactions.

```{r visualise_customer_transactions, echo=TRUE}
keep_customers_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(total_tnx_count > 2) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 30)

plot_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  semi_join(keep_customers_tbl, by = "customer_id")

ggplot(plot_tbl, aes(x = invoice_date, y = customer_id, group = customer_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Transaction Date",
    y = "Customer ID",
    title = "Visualisation of Transaction Times for 30 Customers"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```






# Create Initial BTYD Model


```{r create_initial_btyd_model, echo=TRUE}
daily_cbscbt <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  select(cust = customer_id, date = invoice_date, sales = total_spend) %>%
  dc.ElogToCbsCbt(
    per             = "week",
    T.cal           = as.Date("2010-06-30"),
    merge.same.date = TRUE
    )

params_bgnbd <- daily_cbscbt$cal$cbs %>%
  bgnbd.EstimateParameters()


bgnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration(
  params  = params_bgnbd,
  cal.cbs = daily_cbscbt$cal$cbs,
  censor  = 15
  )

bgnbd.PlotTransactionRateHeterogeneity(params = params_bgnbd)

bgnbd.PlotDropoutRateHeterogeneity(params = params_bgnbd)


bgnbd.Expectation(params = params_bgnbd, t = 52)

bgnbd.PAlive(params = params_bgnbd, x = 5, t.x = 26, T.cal = 30)
```
