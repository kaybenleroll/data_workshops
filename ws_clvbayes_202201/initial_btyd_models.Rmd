# Load Data

We first want to load our datasets and perform some basic manipulation similar
to those done for the association rules mining.

```{r load_transaction_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_data_tbl <- read_rds("data/retail_data_cleaned_tbl.rds")

tnx_data_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


We model the purchase data first, then combine this to create an individual
customer/invoice pairing with the total amount spent as an additional column.

```{r prepare_purchase_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_purchase_tbl <- tnx_data_tbl %>%
  filter(
    quantity > 0,
    exclude == FALSE
    ) %>%
  select(
    invoice_date, invoice_id, stock_code, customer_id, description,
    quantity, price, stock_value
    )

tnx_purchase_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Use of BTYD models assumes a total spend over a period of day and those
differences between the times. This is calculated internally by the various
BTYD routines so we keep just the per-invoice spend.

```{r calculate_customer_daily_spend, echo=TRUE}
daily_spend_invoice_tbl <- tnx_purchase_tbl %>%
  drop_na(customer_id) %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id, invoice_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    invoice_spend = sum(stock_value)
    )

daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>% glimpse()


daily_spend_tbl <- daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    total_spend = sum(invoice_spend),
    tnx_count   = n()
    )

daily_spend_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


Finally, we want to set a date to make the end of the "fitting" data, which
will be used in the various estimation routines to fit parameters of our models.

```{r set_training_data_date, echo=TRUE}
training_data_date <- as.Date("2011-03-31")
```


# Background Theory

Before we start working on fitting and using the various Buy-Till-You-Die
models, we first need to discuss the basic underlying theory and model.

In this model, we assume a customer becomes 'alive' to the business at the
first purchase and then makes purchases stochastically but at a steady-rate
for a period of time, and then 'dies' - i.e. becomes inactive to the business -
hence the use of "Buy-Till-You-Die".

Thus, at a high level these models decompose into modelling the transaction
events using distributions such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial, and then
modelling the 'dropout' process using some other method.

A number of BTYD models exist and for this workshop we will focus on the
BG/NBD model - the Beta-Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution model (though
we will discuss the P/NBD model also).

These models require only two pieces of information about each customer's
purchasing history: the "recency" (when the last transaction occurred) and
"frequency" (the count of transactions made by that customer in a specified
time period).

The notation used to represent this information is

$$
X = (x, t_x, T),
$$
where $x$ is the number of transactions observed in the time period $T$ and
$t_x$ was the time of the last transaction.

From this summary data we can fit both P/NBD and BG/NBD models.


## Beta-Geometric/Negative-Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD) Model

This model relies on a number of base assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with parameters shape $r$ and rate
  $\alpha$. 
  1. After any transaction, a customer becomes inactive with probability $p$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Beta distribution $B(p \, | \, a, b)$ with
  shape parameters $a$ and $b$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout probability $p$ vary
  independently across customers.


Note that it follows from the above assumptions that the probability of a
customer being 'alive' after any transaction is given by the Geometric
distribution, and hence the Beta-Geometric in the name.


## Pareto/Negative-Binomial Distribution (P/NBD) Model

Similar to the BG/NBD model, the P/NBD model relies on five assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with shape $r$ and rate $\alpha$. 
  1. Each customer has an unobserved 'lifetime' of length $\tau$. This point at
  which the customer becomes inactive is distributed as an exponential with
  dropout rate $\mu$.
  1. Heterogeneity in dropout rates across customers follows a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(\mu \, | \, s, \beta)$ with shape parameter $s$ and
  rate parameter $\beta$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout rate $\mu$ vary
  independently across customers.


## Gamma/Gamma Spending Model

The final piece of this approach is to construct a spending model for the
transactions. Similar to transaction rates, spending patterns are often
skewed, so a Gamma distribution is used.

For the Gamma/Gamma model, we use the following assumptions:

  1. Each transaction amount, $v_i$, is distributed according to a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(v_i \, | \, p, \nu)$ with shape parameter $p$ and
  rate parameter $\nu$.
  2. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(p \, | \, q, \gamma)$
