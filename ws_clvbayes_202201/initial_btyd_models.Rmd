# Load Data

We first want to load our datasets and perform some basic manipulation similar
to those done for the association rules mining.

```{r load_transaction_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_data_tbl <- read_rds("data/retail_data_cleaned_tbl.rds")

tnx_data_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


We model the purchase data first, then combine this to create an individual
customer/invoice pairing with the total amount spent as an additional column.

```{r prepare_purchase_data, echo=TRUE}
tnx_purchase_tbl <- tnx_data_tbl %>%
  filter(
    quantity > 0,
    exclude == FALSE
    ) %>%
  select(
    invoice_date, invoice_id, stock_code, customer_id, description,
    quantity, price, stock_value
    )

tnx_purchase_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Use of BTYD models assumes a total spend over a period of day and those
differences between the times. This is calculated internally by the various
BTYD routines so we keep just the per-invoice spend.

```{r calculate_customer_daily_spend, echo=TRUE}
daily_spend_invoice_tbl <- tnx_purchase_tbl %>%
  drop_na(customer_id) %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id, invoice_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    invoice_spend = sum(stock_value)
    )

daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>% glimpse()


daily_spend_tbl <- daily_spend_invoice_tbl %>%
  group_by(invoice_date, customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    total_spend = sum(invoice_spend),
    tnx_count   = n()
    )

daily_spend_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


Finally, we want to set a date to make the end of the "fitting" data, which
will be used in the various estimation routines to fit parameters of our models.

```{r set_training_data_date, echo=TRUE}
training_data_date <- as.Date("2011-03-31")
```


# Background Theory

Before we start working on fitting and using the various Buy-Till-You-Die
models, we first need to discuss the basic underlying theory and model.

In this model, we assume a customer becomes 'alive' to the business at the
first purchase and then makes purchases stochastically but at a steady-rate
for a period of time, and then 'dies' - i.e. becomes inactive to the business -
hence the use of "Buy-Till-You-Die".

Thus, at a high level these models decompose into modelling the transaction
events using distributions such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial, and then
modelling the 'dropout' process using some other method.

A number of BTYD models exist and for this workshop we will focus on the
BG/NBD model - the Beta-Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution model (though
we will discuss the P/NBD model also).

These models require only two pieces of information about each customer's
purchasing history: the "recency" (when the last transaction occurred) and
"frequency" (the count of transactions made by that customer in a specified
time period).

The notation used to represent this information is

$$
X = (x, t_x, T),
$$
where $x$ is the number of transactions observed in the time period $T$ and
$t_x$ was the time of the last transaction.

From this summary data we can fit both P/NBD and BG/NBD models.


## Beta-Geometric/Negative-Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD) Model

This model relies on a number of base assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with parameters shape $r$ and rate
  $\alpha$. 
  1. After any transaction, a customer becomes inactive with probability $p$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Beta distribution $B(p \, | \, a, b)$ with
  shape parameters $a$ and $b$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout probability $p$ vary
  independently across customers.


Note that it follows from the above assumptions that the probability of a
customer being 'alive' after any transaction is given by the Geometric
distribution, and hence the Beta-Geometric in the name.


## Pareto/Negative-Binomial Distribution (P/NBD) Model

Similar to the BG/NBD model, the P/NBD model relies on five assumptions:

  1. While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a
  Poisson process with transaction rate $\lambda$.
  1. Heterogeneity in $\lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(\lambda \, | \, \alpha, r)$ with shape $r$ and rate $\alpha$. 
  1. Each customer has an unobserved 'lifetime' of length $\tau$. This point at
  which the customer becomes inactive is distributed as an exponential with
  dropout rate $\mu$.
  1. Heterogeneity in dropout rates across customers follows a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(\mu \, | \, s, \beta)$ with shape parameter $s$ and
  rate parameter $\beta$.
  1. The transaction rate $\lambda$ and the dropout rate $\mu$ vary
  independently across customers.


## Gamma/Gamma Spending Model

The final piece of this approach is to construct a spending model for the
transactions. Similar to transaction rates, spending patterns are often
skewed, so a Gamma distribution is used.

For the Gamma/Gamma model, we use the following assumptions:

  1. Each transaction amount, $v_i$, is distributed according to a Gamma
  distribution $\Gamma(v_i \, | \, p, \nu)$ with shape parameter $p$ and
  rate parameter $\nu$.
  2. Heterogeneity in $p$ follows a Gamma distribution
  $\Gamma(p \, | \, q, \gamma)$




## BTYD Visualisations

Despite our extensive exploration of the data earlier, the concepts around 
BTYD modelling suggest a few more than are worth exploring, so we will look at
those now.

To start with, it might be worth understanding a bit more about when customers
are 'born' in the system - that is, the date on which they make their first
purchase. Another important quantity is the time between transactions for a
customer, we we will visualise these.

```{r construct_customer_first_date, echo=TRUE}
customer_firstdate_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    first_tnx_date  = min(invoice_date),
    total_tnx_count = n()
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    cohort_qtr = first_tnx_date %>% as.yearqtr(),
    cohort_ym  = first_tnx_date %>% format("%Y %m"),
    
    .after = "customer_id"
    )


customer_firstdate_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

Now that we have a first date for each customer, we look at the total number
of customers joining at each date.

```{r plot_customer_first_dates, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  count(first_tnx_date, name = "n_customer")

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_line(aes(x = first_tnx_date, y = n_customer)) +
  labs(
    x = "First Transaction Date",
    y = "New Customers",
    title = "Plot of Count of New Customer by Date"
    )
```

We know look at how time differences between purchases are distributed.

```{r plot_transaction_time_diffs, echo=TRUE}
customer_tnx_diffs_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    time_diff = diff(invoice_date) %>% as.numeric() %>% divide_by(7)
  )

mean_diff <- customer_tnx_diffs_tbl %>% pull(time_diff) %>% mean()

ggplot(customer_tnx_diffs_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = time_diff), bins = 50) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean_diff), colour = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Histogram of Differences Between Transactions for Customers",
    subtitle = glue(
      "Mean Difference is {mean_diff} weeks", mean_diff = mean_diff %>% round(2)
      )
    )
```


We also want to look at a number of customers and make some line plots of their
transactions.

```{r visualise_customer_transactions, echo=TRUE}
keep_customers_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(total_tnx_count > 2) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 30)

plot_tbl <- daily_spend_tbl %>%
  semi_join(keep_customers_tbl, by = "customer_id")

ggplot(plot_tbl, aes(x = invoice_date, y = customer_id, group = customer_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Transaction Date",
    y = "Customer ID",
    title = "Visualisation of Transaction Times for 30 Customers"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))
```


## Investigate Cohorts

Finally, we want to take a look at the distribution of transaction times based
on various first-transaction cohorts in the data.


```{r plot_distribution_first_transaction, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(customer_firstdate_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = first_tnx_date), bins = 50) +
  labs(
    x = "Date of First Transaction",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of New Customer Start Dates"
    )
```

We also want to get a sense of the total count of customers in each cohort.

```{r construct_qtr_cohort_column_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  count(cohort_qtr, name = "customer_count") %>%
  mutate(cohort_qtr = cohort_qtr %>% as.character())
  
ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cohort_qtr, y = customer_count)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Customer Cohort",
    y = "Customer Count",
    title = "Bar Plot of Customer Quarterly Cohort Sizes"
    )
```

We also want to see the monthly cohorts:

```{r construct_ym_cohort_column_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  count(cohort_ym, name = "customer_count") %>%
  mutate(cohort_ym = cohort_ym %>% as.character())

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_col(aes(x = cohort_ym, y = customer_count)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Customer Cohort",
    y = "Customer Count",
    title = "Bar Plot of Customer Monthly Cohort Sizes"
    ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 20, vjust = 0.5)
    )
```


For the cohort analysis, we start with a boxplot of the time difference between
transactions by cohort.

```{r plot_cohort_differences_boxplot}
plot_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  filter(first_tnx_date <= training_data_date) %>%
  inner_join(customer_tnx_diffs_tbl, by = "customer_id") %>%
  mutate(cohort_qtr = cohort_qtr %>% as.character())

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = cohort_qtr, y = time_diff)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "Cohort",
    y = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    title = "Boxplot of Time Differences by Starting Cohort"
    )
```

We also construct a density plot of the time differences for these cohorts.

```{r investigate_cohort_transaction_times, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(plot_tbl, aes(x = time_diff, colour = cohort_qtr)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  geom_dl(aes(label = cohort_qtr), method = "top.bumpup", stat = "density") +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Comparison Density Plot for Transaction Time Differences Between Cohorts"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

And we also look at a facetted-histogram

```{r investigate_cohort_timediffs_facets, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = time_diff), bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(vars(cohort_qtr), scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(
    x = "Time Difference (weeks)",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Facetted Histograms of Time Between Transactions"
    )

```


### Investigate Dropout Rates

We want to plot some visualisations of the lifetime and dropout rate of
customers in each cohort.


```{r estimate_cohort_dropout_rates, echo=TRUE}
cohort_dropout_est_tbl <- customer_firstdate_tbl %>%
  select(
    customer_id, first_tnx_date, cohort_qtr, cohort_ym
    ) %>%
  filter(
    first_tnx_date <= training_data_date
    ) %>%
  inner_join(daily_spend_tbl, by = "customer_id") %>%
  group_by(cohort_qtr, customer_id) %>%
  mutate(
    final_tnx_date = max(invoice_date)
    ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(
    customer_id, cohort_qtr, first_tnx_date, final_tnx_date
    ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(
    obs_lifetime = difftime(final_tnx_date, first_tnx_date, units = "week") %>%
      as.numeric()
    ) %>%
  filter(obs_lifetime > 0) %>%
  group_by(cohort_qtr) %>%
  summarise(
    .groups = "drop",
    
    lifetimes = list(obs_lifetime)
    )

cohort_dropout_est_tbl %>% glimpse()
```
