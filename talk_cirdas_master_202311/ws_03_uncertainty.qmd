# Knowledge


## Donald Rumsfeld

Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me,
because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know.

We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some
things we do not know.

But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know.

And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free
countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.

```{r}
#| label: known_unknown_plots
#| echo: false

plot_tbl <- expand_grid(
    Belief  = c("Known", "Unknown"),
    Reality = c("Known", "Unknown")
    )

ggplot(plot_tbl) +
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = Belief, y = Reality),
    width = 0.95, height = 0.95, fill = "grey"
    )
```

It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble...

... It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.
