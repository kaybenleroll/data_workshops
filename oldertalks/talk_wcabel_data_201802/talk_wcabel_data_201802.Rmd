# What is (Big) Data?


## Dirty Little Secret

\


You (Probably) Do Not Have a Big Data Problem




## Sizes of Data

Hadley Wickham's Interview with a Data Scientist

Peadar Coyle

---

### Three Data Sizes

\

In-Memory

\

On-Disk

\

Multi-Disk



## Three Problem Sizes

\

Sampleable Problems

\

Parallelisable Problems

\

Irreducible Problems

---

### Sampleable Problems

\

$\sim$ 90% of problems

\


---

### Parallelisable Problems

\

$\sim$ 9% of problems

\



---

### Irreducible Problems

\

$\sim$ 1% of problems



# What Does Big Data Mean?

---

Various definitions

\

Generally bigger than one machine


## Cynical Definition

\

"Big Data" is a marketing term used by salespeople to extract large sums of
money from companies with a severe case of FOMO.


## Circular Definition

\

A big data problem is one where big data solutions work best


## Practical Definition

\

Software infrastructure to assist in the processing and use of large datasets




# Data in Insurance

---

Most classic insurance problems are small data


## Actuarial Problems

\

Pricing

\

Reserving

\

Capital Modelling


---

### Loss-Costing DNF Business

\

5-10k Policies

\

SoV data can be large

\

Claim data poor quality


---

### Estimating Claims Reserves

\

Estimate total claim amounts

\

Data sparse

\

Chain Ladder often ineffective

---

### ICT Pricing

\

Exposure data aggregated

\

Partial view of claims (censored)


---

### Cost of Guarantees

\

With-profit Funds

\

Quant finance

\

MonteCarlo simulation


---

### Estimating Lapse Risk

\

Customer segmentation

\

Survival analysis



## Other Problems

---

Less traditionally 'actuarial'


---

### Marketing Campaigns

\

Limited marketing budget

\

Optimise call list

---

### Underwriting Fraud

\

Most data missing

\

Find fraudulent or misleading applications

---

### Internal Operations

\

Communications data, emails

\

Identify bottlenecks

\

Improve customer turnaround





## Some Predictions

\


- Catastrophe Modelling
- Uplift Modelling / Marketing Evaluation
- Lapse Modelling (Churn)
- Mortality Modelling
- Risk Modelling and Reserving
- Fraud Investigation
- Internal Communications
- Compliance
